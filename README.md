*Optuna Workshop

Welcome to the Optuna Workshop repository. This educational resource is tailored for master's students who possess a foundational understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques but are new to the Optuna framework. This workshop aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to Optuna, an advanced hyperparameter optimization library, and guide you through its practical applications in machine learning.

Overview
Optuna is an open-source software framework designed to automate the process of hyperparameter optimization, which is crucial for enhancing the performance of machine learning models. This workshop will cover the essential concepts, setup procedures, and practical implementations of Optuna, enabling you to efficiently optimize your models.
